Solution branch: `a-2-show`

## Instructions

Show the todos retrieved from the backend service.

## Hints

Use React presentational aka functional components. These are pure functions that don't have side effects.

- Make a `TodoList` component that receives `todos` from `props`.
- `map` over the `todos` Array and return a new `Todo` component for each `todo`.
