Solution branch: `b-2-toggle`

## Instructions

Toggle the `completed` status of a `todo`.

## Hints

- Create a `onToggleCompleted` function which looks up a `todo` by its `id` and changes the `completed` status.

- Create an `async` function `saveTodo` which receives a single `todo` to be updated as an argument.
