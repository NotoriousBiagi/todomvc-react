The git repo includes branches with starter code, the finished application, and all the steps in between. These tables may help to visualize the branches.

| Starter Code | Finished App |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| `starter`    | `finished`   |


| Getting & Showing | Adding & Toggling | Filtering          | Deleting & Editing    |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| `a-1-get`         | `b-1-add`         | `c-1-filter`       | `d-1-delete`          |
| `a-2-show`        | `b-2-toggle`      | `c-2-link`         | `d-2-clear-completed` |
|                   |                   | `c-3-active-count` | `d-3-edit`            |

With the exception of the `starter` and `finished` branches, each branch is named with a prefix like `a-1-`. This branch name signature is `<letter>-<number>-<feature implemented in current branch>`. The branches are cumulative and the ordering is alphabetized first and then numeric (i.e., `b-1-add` builds on the code in `a-2-show` which builds on `a-1-get`).
